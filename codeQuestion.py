#Starting working............
#This code uses the `yield from` statement to iterate over a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with an "author" key. Here's a breakdown:
#
#- `yield from`: This is the core part of the expression. It yields (i.e., produces) values from another iterable (in this case, the generator expression that follows). The `from` keyword indicates that we're transitioning to another iterable.
#
#- `{book.get("author") for book in books if book.get("author")}`: This is a generator expression that:
#
#  - Iterates over each dictionary in the `books` list.
#  - For each dictionary, checks if it has an "author" key using the `get()` method. If it does, it yields (i.e., produces) the value of the "author" key.
#
#- The `yield from` statement effectively "yields" these values one by one, producing them to the caller on each iteration.
#
#So, in essence, this code is equivalent to writing a simple loop that iterates over the list of books and yields their authors:
#
#```python
#for book in books:
#    if 'author' in book:
#        yield book['author']
#```
#
#However, using `yield from` can be more efficient because it allows for lazy evaluation, meaning that instead of producing all values at once and then storing them in memory (like a loop would), Python just yields each value on the fly as needed. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to process data in chunks.
#
#Here's an example to illustrate how this works:
#
#```python
#import random
#
#class Book:
#    def __init__(self, author):
#        self.author = author
#
#books = [Book(f"Author {i}") for i in range(10)]
#
#for book in yield from books:
#    print(book.author)
#```
#
#In this case, the output will be a sequence of authors (e.g., "Author 0", "Author 1", ..., "Author 9"), one author per line.
